Smart Tabs is a Chrome extension that replaces your new tab page with a dashboard that groups your open tabs by domain. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.

## Information We Collect
